Additionally, after v1.0.0 release, any breaking change will have a `!` appended to type/scope and `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` in the message footer.

## Message body
- uses the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
- includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior

## Message footer

### Referencing issues

Closed issues should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" header like this:

```
Closes: #234
```

or in the case of multiple issues:

```
Closes: #123, #245, #992
```

Referenced, but not closed issues should use "Refs" footer header:

```
Refs: #123, #245, #992
```

### Breaking changes

All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the description of the change, justification and migration notes. This should be the last part of a commit message.

```
BREAKING CHANGE:

`port-runner` command line option has changed to `runner-port`, so that it is
consistent with the configuration file syntax.

To migrate your project, change all the commands, where you use `--port-runner`
to `--runner-port`.
```
